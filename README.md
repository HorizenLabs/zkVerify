# zkVerify

Implementation of a node for the **zkVerify Proof Verification Layer**.

It is based on the [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) framework.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ***zkVerify*** is currently in an early **testnet** stage.
> The plan for going live on Mainnet will be communicated later.

## What is zkVerify
zkVerify is a **L1** blockchain designed to provide verification for zero knowledge proofs.
As a high performance, public, decentralized, reliable, and secure blockchain, zkVerify has dedicated proof verification methods written in Rust, and available to be used in a modular and composable way.

## Motivation
As execution and data availability have been offloaded from monolithic blockchain stacks, we believe that proof verification and settlement need specialization. This system provides such, enabling the next wave of innovation for ZK cryptography within Web3 and beyond.

### Prohibitive Costs
The proof verification market is estimated to incur $100+ million in security expenses alone for zkRollups in 2024, extending to $1.5 billion by 2028 when including ZK applications.
The verification of a single ZK proof on Ethereum can consume upwards of 200,000 to 300,000 gas units, depending on the proof type. Beyond nominal fees today, the variability of future fees inhibits product adoption.

### Hampering Innovation
Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are design documents that outline new features, standards, or processes for the Ethereum blockchain, serving as a primary mechanism for proposing changes to the network.
However, the bottlenecks in approving and implementing EIPs hinder the adoption of cutting-edge proving systems, limiting the potential advancements in scalability and privacy. 

For instance, the choice to standardize around the BN254 curve, while practical at the time of implementation, means that operations involving other elliptic curves are not directly supported and are prohibitively expensive to execute.

## Building and running

### Prerequisites

Install Rust toolchain. Instructions available [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

For Mac users, after installation run:

```bash
brew install protobuf
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Build from source

To build the client from source, clone this repository and run the following commands from the root of the project:

```bash
git checkout <latest tagged release>
cargo build --release
```

#### Running GitHub workflows on local environment
> ⚠️ It is currently supported only on Ubuntu Linux

Use the `./ci/run_locally.sh` script to run GitHub Actions workflows locally.
By default, the script runs all the workflows listed under `.github/workflows/CI-orchestrator.yml` file.
However, an interactive mode is available, allowing you to choose workflows to run individually if needed.

```bash
./ci/run_locally.sh --help
Usage: ./ci/run_locally.sh [-i | --help]

Options:
  -i        Run the script in interactive mode, allowing you to select workflows.
  --help    Show this help message and exit.
```

### Run

It is possible to run tests with:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Run testnet node

To run a testnet node:

```bash
cd target/release
./zkv-node --chain test
```

The client will connect to `ZKV Testnet` and start syncing blockchain data, with default path at `$HOME/.local/share/` (double check with log `💾 Database: RocksDb at`).

For entirely removing blockchain data:

```bash
cd target/release
./zkv-node purge --chain test
```

### Run dev node

To run a local dev node:

```bash
cd target/release
./zkv-node --dev
```

The client will run a chain with a single validator (Alice) and start producing blocks.

## Hardware Requirements for Validators
On-chain weights have been computed on an [Amazon AWS EC2 C7a.2xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/it/ec2/instance-types/c7a/) instance with a storage of type IO2 8000 IOPS.
We recommend adopting at least an equivalent machine, with at least 50GB of storage space, if you plan to run a validator node.

## Docker

zkVerify includes some Docker files for building the client and running one or more nodes locally.
For more information, see [docker/README.md](docker/README.md).

We also provide Docker images to run a validator, boot or RPC node directly in the public testnet, via a user-friendly installation and deployment process. Please take a look at [How to run a node](https://docs.zkverify.io/tutorials/how_to_run_a_node/getting_started) section of the official documentation.
